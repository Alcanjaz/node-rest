# node-rest
A simple rest-api made with node.js and mongoDB as a practice of Web Developing


To run this program yo must enter in the proyect folder and run "npm start" and test making the http requests in
the localhost:3000 using Postman (for the moment).

To do list:
-Make a client using Vue.js
-Some other changes to the API, because i doesn't finish the course (but does it works)
